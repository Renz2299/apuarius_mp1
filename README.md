## The Product
The Aquarius product is a conceptual design for a water quality tester that was developed during my final year of university. The aim behind the product is to solve the problem of sewage contamination affecting regular water users as well as the local environment.

The product is designed with swimmers and surfers in mind, allowing them to rapidly and easily test water quality due to it's use a microfluidics technology and intuitive user interface.

## Project Conception
Since Aquarius is still a conceptual design and requires at least 2 more years of work to get it in production, a start up site felt fitting. It brings awareness to the product as well as the key problem at hand and begins the marketing campaign without having a physical product ready to sell.

Below are the initial pen & paper wireframes for the site:
